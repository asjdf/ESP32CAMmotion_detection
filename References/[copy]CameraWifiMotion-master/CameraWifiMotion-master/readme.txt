                        ==================================================

This is a Arduino IDE sketch to use one of the cheap (5ukp from eBay) ESP32 camera boards as a motion detecting security camera.
It captures an image around 4 times a second, each time comparing this with the previous image looking for any changes.  If significant change is detected it captures a higher res image and stores it in internal memory (also to SD card if one is installed) and can also email the image if required.

These cheap cameras are surprisingly good apart from poor performance in low light conditions, if anyone knows how to improve this please let me know. 

The sketch can use OTA (Over the air updates) to update the software, this can be enabled/disabled in the main settings of the sketch.
If you use OTA do not select the "ESP32-cam" board in the Arduino IDE, use "ESP32 Dev Module" and make sure PSRAM is enabled otherwise OTA will not work.
In an attempt to give some form of security to OTA I have set up the sketch so that when OTA is enabled you can not access it until you have entered a "secret password", the password is entered in the form "http://<ip address of esp>?pwd=12345678".  You can change this password in the main settings (OTAPassword).

                   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you wish to use the email facility you need to enter your email details in gmail_esp.h and note the security settings may need changing on your gmail account.

There is a zip file containing the libraries used.  The main ones you will need to install are:
  ESP32_mail_client, ESP_wifimanager and Time.

The last 11 images captured are stored in the onboard Spiffs memory and these can be viewed on the web page this device 
generates. If you install a sd card it will store all captured images on it.  It has the ability to capture images at a higher resolution but will not be able to store 11 images (also it may become unstable as it seems to struggle with the amount of data being processed in my experience). 

It uses WifiManager so first time the ESP starts it will create an access point "ESPCamera" which you need to connect to in order to enter your wifi details.  
             default password = "12345678"   (note-it may not work if anything other than 8 characters long for some reason?)

             Once you have entered your wifi password it will restart and you can then connect to it in your browser
             at the address:     http://ESPcam1.local     (if your browser / config supports it)

The motion detection is based on - https://eloquentarduino.github.io/2020/01/motion-detection-with-esp32-cam-only-arduino-version/
It works by repeatedly capturing a greyscale image (320x240 pixels).  This image is split up in to 20x20 
pixel blocks (i.e. 16 x 12 blocks for the complete image).  All the pixel values in each block are averaged to give a single 
number for each block between 0 and 255 (i.e. average of the block).
These resulting 16x12 blocks are then compared to the previously captured one and if the value of any block has varied by more 
then the "block" setting then this block is declared changed.
If enough blocks have changed (percentage of active image detection area, the "image" setting) then motion is detected.
So the settings you can vary equate to:
        Block = how much brighness variation in a block is required to flag it as changed
        Image = how much of the image area needs to change to count as movement detected
When motion detecting is enabled it will show the current average image brightness along with what motion it is currently detecting
in the format "Readings: brightness:113, 0 changed blocks out of 64".  You can use this to fine tune your detection settings.

There are three settings for the motion detection, the first is how much change in average brightness in a block will count as
that block has changed, the second two numbers refer to the number of blocks in the image which have changed since the last 
image was captured and it will trigger as motion detected if this is between these two values.
So the easiest way to set it up is to set the two trigger levels to max and the trigger level to around 15, then in the "raw data"
page with motion detection disabled refresh a couple of times until you are seeing very low values in the top window (difference).
now if you move someone/something in to the view of the camera and refresh the page you will be able to see what differences
the software has detected in the image (fine tune the detection threshold for the best results).
Now if you go back to the main page and enable motion detection you can watch the levels being detected on the second line
on the page (i.e. "Readings: brightness:105, 1 changed blocks out of 64").

There is a grid of tick boxes on the right of the main screen, this is a mask to set which parts of the image are used
when detecting motion (i.e. only the ticked areas are used).  This 4 x 3 grid results in mask sections of 16 blocks (4x4) 


It also has the following URLs you can use:

        http://<esp ip address> /ping - responds with either 'enabled' or 'disabled', just so you know it is still working
                                /log - log page of the device activities
                                /test - used for testing bits of code etc.
                                /reboot - restarts the esp32 camera module
                                /default - sets all settings back to defaults
                                /live - capture and display a live image from the camera
                                /images - display the 10 images stored in Spiffs (Image width in percent can be specified in URL with http://x.x.x.x/images?width=90)
                                /bootlog - log of times the device has been switched on / rebooted (handy for checking it is stable)
                                /data - this is the updating text on the main page but handy for a quick check of status
                                /imagedata - show raw block data
                                /ota - update firmware (requires password entered first)
                                /img - just display a plain jpg 
                                       defaults to the live greyscale image or stored images selected with /img?pic=x
                                       for smaller pre capture images add 100 to x.


If using a gmail account for emails your account needs to be set to "Allow less secure apps: ON"   
  see:  https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
  you then need to edit gmail_esp32.h with your details

 
-----------------

Adjusting the settings:

if you check the "difference" section on the  "raw data" page, if all is well you should just be seeing 0s and 1s , meaning each image it captures is pretty much identical to the last one (this will be much higher at night as the camera gain is
increased which also increases interference).  The two sections below being the current and last image captured which it
compares to detect movement.
The "Detection threshold" setting on the main page sets at what value it will declare one of these blocks has changed.

On the main page watch where it says "0 changed blocks out of 128"
ideally it should never change from 0 unless something is moving but tends to pick up the odd one as light levels change etc.  

The trigger between settings are reffering to the number displayed in "Current detection level".  If you watch this as something is moving in the image you will get an idea of what sort of value to be looking out for.

Notes:

If you ever need to erase the stored wifi settings or if the esp32 goes in to a power loop where you are unable to get
Wifimanager to work see - https://www.robmiles.com/journal/2019/05/26/esp32reset

I am a very amateur programmer so any help/advice improving this would be very greatly received. - alanesq@disroot.org
This sketch includes a lot of other peoples code from many sources which I have included links to   
Most specifically - https://eloquentarduino.github.io/2020/01/motion-detection-with-esp32-cam-only-arduino-version/
which was just what I had been looking for and without which I could not have created this project.                  

It is vital that the ESP has a good 5volt supply (at least 0.5amp capable - although it draws around 
120mA most of the time) otherwise you get all sorts of weird things happening including very slow network response times.
The esp camera board also seems very sensitive to what is around the antenna and this can cause wifi to slow or stop
if you put it in a case or mount it on a pcb etc.  (If it is going in a case I think an external antenna is required).
Also I find that a smoothing capacitor is required on the 3.3v side otherwise the LED turning on/off can cause a
lot of problems (specifically causing it to keep re-triggering and other random behaviour).
Using the flash can often trigger such problems if there is any problem with the power supply.
